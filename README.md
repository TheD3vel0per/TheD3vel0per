## About Me
Iâ€™m Devam, a second year Computer Science and Mathematics student at the University of British Columbia who enjoys doing mathematics and programming!

Ever since I was a toddler, I have been passionate about technology. I want to make the world as passionate about technology as I am by showing people how to use it to solve problems.  I started taking computers apart when I was a toddler, creating websites when I was in primary school, and writing software programs not long after. All of the projects that you will see on this website are from my high school days and beyond.

## What I'm doing

 * **A-Mais Tech**, is a company which specializes in making financial software for municipal governements.
 * Tinkering with Abstract Linear Algebra, with emphasis on applications such as Machine Learning and Data Modeling.
